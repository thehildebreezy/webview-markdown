# webview-markdown
 Inline Markdown Editor for use with webviews

Intended for use embedded in apps that don't have good rich text options for their buffers, it provides a completely free standing web implementation that automatically renders markdown expressions in place. 

It is intended only to target webview systems and doesn't offer much in the way of guarentees in Gecko, or especially in internet explorer.
